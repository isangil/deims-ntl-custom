Ntl Menu will not work as you expect -- all menu links pointing to nodes 
will likely dissapear.  Thus, the hierarchical structure will be in dissarray
and some links will be missing. On a positive note, this will save you
the work of creating links to static links.  Also, the node links are
fairly easy to recreate, as the pathauto works wonderfully.
